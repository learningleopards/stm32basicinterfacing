- 🌱 **Task description:-** We explore a keyword-based spoken language understanding system, in which the intent of the user can directly be derived from the detection of a sequence of keywords in the query. We focus on the keyword spotting method and edge impulse which is the leading development platform for machine learning on edge devices and free for developers. Edge impulse is used to perform audio data classification. In this stage 3 we are working on connection of chip(sound sensor) to ADC interface and display the reading of the sound sensor through serial communication on putty.exe. An analog-to-digital converter(ADC) converts an analog voltage to a digital value that a microcontroller can use. The code below is the part of the main.c file that used to interface sound sensor with the ADC:

The output "sound intensity" interface with ADC that read by the sound sensor will be displaying in the putty.exe through serial communication.
